# Canonical-Correlation-Analysis-Report
This project aims to apply the analytics skills to do  Canonical Correlation Analysis to a real-world problem. I used "Fat Supply Quantity" dataset to perform this analysis. Canonical correlation analysis allows us to summarize the relationship into lesser number of statistics while preserving the main facets of the relationships.
